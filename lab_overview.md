<h2><span style="color:red;">Python testing with pytest</span></h2>

### What Is pytest?

Here are a few of the reasons pytest stands out above many other test frameworks:
- Simple tests are simple to write in pytest.
- Complex tests are still simple to write.
- Tests are easy to read.
- Tests are easy to read. (So important it’s listed twice.)
- You can get started in seconds.
- You use assert to fail a test, not things like self.assertEqual() or self.assertLessThan().
Just assert.
- You can use pytest to run tests written for unittest or nose.

pytest is being actively developed and maintained by a passionate and growing
community. It’s so extensible and flexible that it will easily fit into your work
flow. And because it’s installed separately from your Python version, you can
use the same version of pytest on multiple versions of Python.

### About

A robust Python testing tool, pytest can be used for all types and levels of
software testing. pytest can be used by development teams, QA teams, independent testing groups, individuals practicing TDD, and open source
projects. In fact, projects all over the Internet have switched from unittest
or nose to pytest, including Mozilla and Dropbox. Why? Because pytest
offers powerful features such as assert rewriting, a third-party plugin model,
and a powerful yet simple fixture model that is unmatched in any other
testing framework.

pytest is a software test framework, which means pytest is a command-line
tool that automatically finds tests you’ve written, runs the tests, and reports
the results. It has a library of goodies that you can use in your tests to help
you test more effectively. It can be extended by writing plugins or installing
third-party plugins. It can be used to test Python distributions. And it
integrates easily with other tools like continuous integration and web
automation.
