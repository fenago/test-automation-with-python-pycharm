LabÂ . 
----------------------------

During refactoring, use pytest's markers to ignore certain breaking
tests.


Sometimes you want to overhaul a chunk of code and don't want to stare
at a broken test. You could comment it out. But `pytest` provides an
easier (and more feature-ful) alternative for skipping tests.

We'll show this in action while implementing:

-   The ability to add multiple guardians at once

-   A concept of the "primary guardian" of a player

Bulk Guardians
==============

Players usually have more than one Guardian. When you have a list of
Guardians, you might prefer a different method that lets you add them
all at once.

Let's implement this in TDD fashion, by first writing a
`test_add_guardians` test in `test_player.py` that fails:

``` {.prism-code .language-python .content style="color:#9CDCFE;background-color:#1E1E1E;font-size:large"}
def test_add_guardians():    p = Player('Tatiana', 'Jones')    # Add one guardian    g1 = Guardian('Mary', 'Jones')    p.add_guardian(g1)    # Later, add some more    g2 = Guardian('Joanie', 'Johnson')    g3 = Guardian('Jerry', 'Johnson')    p.add_guardians([g2, g3])    assert [g1, g2, g3] == p.guardians
```

We don't have a method `add_guardians` and so the test fails. Perhaps we
are busy on something else and we'd like `pytest` to not yell at us, but
we don't want to comment out or (worse) delete the test.

Instead, let's import `pytest` and put a decorator for the `skip` marker
on that test:

``` {.prism-code .language-python .content style="color: rgb(156, 220, 254); background-color: rgb(30, 30, 30); font-size: large;"}
import pytestfrom laxleague.guardian import Guardianfrom laxleague.player import Playerdef test_construction():    p = Player('Tatiana', 'Jones')    assert 'Tatiana' == p.first_name    assert 'Jones' == p.last_name    assert [] == p.guardiansdef test_add_guardian():    g = Guardian('Mary', 'Jones')    p = Player('Tatiana', 'Jones')    p.add_guardian(g)    assert [g] == p.guardians@pytest.mark.skip(reason='Have not yet implemented method')def test_add_guardians():    p = Player('Tatiana', 'Jones')    # Add one guardian    g1 = Guardian('Mary', 'Jones')    p.add_guardian(g1)    # Later, add some more    g2 = Guardian('Joanie', 'Johnson')    g3 = Guardian('Jerry', 'Johnson')    p.add_guardians([g2, g3])    assert [g1, g2, g3] == p.guardians
```

Remember, we don't have to manually type the import...just start typing
`@pyt` and let PyCharm autocomplete using `Ctrl-Space Ctrl-Space`.

Now when the tests run (automatically, thanks to `Toggle auto-test`),
they don't fail, but they do indicate a test was ignored:

[![Ignored
Tests](./images/ignored_tests.png "Ignored Tests")](./images/ignored_tests.png)

With our failing test in place, let's implement the missing method. In
`player.py`, clone the existing `add_guardian` method, then change its
arguments and implementation:

``` {.prism-code .language-python .content style="color: rgb(156, 220, 254); background-color: rgb(30, 30, 30); font-size: large;"}
from dataclasses import dataclass, fieldfrom typing import Listfrom laxleague.guardian import Guardian@dataclassclass Player:    """ A lacrosse player in the league """    first_name: str    last_name: str    guardians: List[Guardian] = field(default_factory=list)    def add_guardian(self, guardian: Guardian):        self.guardians.append(guardian)    def add_guardians(self, guardians: List[Guardian]):        self.guardians.extend(guardians)
```

We can now remove the `skip` marker and the test passes. Remember to
remove the now-unused `pytest` import in `test_player.py` using
`Optimize Imports`.

Some Typing Cleanup
===================

Eager readers might have spotted a type hinting flaw: our code breaks
the [Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you
return](https://m.oursky.com/type-hints-better-type-at-python-28de692c3a4b)
rule.

That is, our new method wants a `List`. When really, it will take a
Python "iterable".

For example, our test passes in a *list* of guardians. It's immutable.
Might as well change it to be a tuple:

``` {.prism-code .language- .content style="color: rgb(156, 220, 254); background-color: rgb(30, 30, 30); font-size: large;"}
    p.add_guardians((g2, g3))
```

Doing so breaks Python type checking:

[![Type
Checking](./images/type_checking.png "Type Checking")](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/guide/static/b01c87d0e05f9bceddf2f369c5ad2a68/5bb8b/type_checking.png)

Let's change our `add_guardians` to accept any kind of `Iterable`:

``` {.prism-code .language-python .content style="color: rgb(156, 220, 254); background-color: rgb(30, 30, 30); font-size: large;"}
from dataclasses import dataclass, fieldfrom typing import List, Iterablefrom laxleague.guardian import Guardian@dataclassclass Player:    """ A lacrosse player in the league """    first_name: str    last_name: str    guardians: List[Guardian] = field(default_factory=list)    def add_guardian(self, guardian: Guardian):        self.guardians.append(guardian)    def add_guardians(self, guardians: Iterable[Guardian]):        self.guardians.extend(guardians)
```

Tests still pass and type checking now passes.

Primary Guardian
================

For the second feature, let's use the same process: write a failing
test, temporarily mark it with `skip`, then implement it and remove the
mark.

Our feature will work like this: whichever guardian is added first is
the primary guardian. In `test_player.py` we add
`test_primary_guardian`, with the mark already in place:

``` {.prism-code .language-python .content style="color: rgb(156, 220, 254); background-color: rgb(30, 30, 30); font-size: large;"}
@pytest.mark.skipdef test_primary_guardian():    p = Player('Tatiana', 'Jones')    # Add one guardian    g1 = Guardian('Mary', 'Jones')    p.add_guardian(g1)    # Later, add some more    g2 = Guardian('Joanie', 'Johnson')    g3 = Guardian('Jerry', 'Johnson')    p.add_guardians((g2, g3))    assert g1 == p.primary_guardian
```

Now time for the implementation. We're doing this as a Python
"property", so add the following in `player.py`:

``` {.prism-code .language-python .content style="color: rgb(156, 220, 254); background-color: rgb(30, 30, 30); font-size: large;"}
from dataclasses import dataclass, fieldfrom typing import List, Iterablefrom laxleague.guardian import Guardian@dataclassclass Player:    """ A lacrosse player in the league """    first_name: str    last_name: str    guardians: List[Guardian] = field(default_factory=list)    def add_guardian(self, guardian: Guardian):        self.guardians.append(guardian)    def add_guardians(self, guardians: Iterable[Guardian]):        self.guardians.extend(guardians)    @property    def primary_guardian(self):        return self.guardians[0]
```

*Tip: Use the `property` LiveTemplate in PyCharm to speed up the
generation of a property.*

Remove the `@pytest.mark.skip` mark from `test_primary_guardian` and the
test now passes.

Conclusion
==========

The `pytest.mark.skip` facility, with related `skipIf` and `xFail`, have
a broad set of uses. As you mature in test writing, start to include
other people, and have tests that execute in different environments,
you'll put them to good use.
