----------------------------

Make your tests more focused by moving sample data to pytest fixtures.

Each test recreates `Player` and `Guardian` instances, which is
repetitive and distracts from the test's purpose. [pytest
fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html) give a rich
infrastructure for your test data.

In this tutorial step we convert our tests to use fixtures, which we
then share between files using `conftest.py`.

Make a `Player` Once
====================

We have a `Player` instance that we currently make in four of our tests.
It's the same instance with the same arguments. It would be nice to
avoid repetition and let our tests focus on the logic under test,
instead of setting up a baseline of test data.

Let's make a `pytest` fixture named `player_one` which constructs and
returns a `Player`:

``` {.prism-code .language-python .content style="color:#9CDCFE;background-color:#1E1E1E;font-size:large"}
import pytestfrom laxleague.guardian import Guardianfrom laxleague.player import Player@pytest.fixturedef player_one() -> Player:    return Player('Tatiana', 'Jones')
```

This fixture can now be used as an argument to your tests. `pytest` will
find the "appropriate" (more on this later) fixture with that name,
invoke it, and pass in the result:

``` {.prism-code .language-python .content style="color:#9CDCFE;background-color:#1E1E1E;font-size:large"}
def test_construction(player_one):    assert 'Tatiana' == player_one.first_name    assert 'Jones' == player_one.last_name    assert [] == player_one.guardians
```

Our tests still pass. We then make the same change in the other tests,
taking the `player_one` fixture as an argument instead of constructing a
`Player` in the test body.

Let's next make a fixture to hold the `Guardian` list:

``` {.prism-code .language-python .content style="color:#9CDCFE;background-color:#1E1E1E;font-size:large"}
from typing import Tupleimport pytestfrom laxleague.guardian import Guardianfrom laxleague.player import Player@pytest.fixturedef player_one() -> Player:    return Player('Tatiana', 'Jones')@pytest.fixturedef guardians() -> Tuple[Guardian, ...]:    g1 = Guardian('Mary', 'Jones')    g2 = Guardian('Joanie', 'Johnson')    g3 = Guardian('Jerry', 'Johnson')    return g1, g2, g3
```

After converting all the tests to use these fixtures, our
`test_player.py` looks like the following:

``` {.prism-code .language-python .content style="color: rgb(156, 220, 254); background-color: rgb(30, 30, 30); font-size: large;"}
import pytestdef test_construction(player_one):    assert 'Tatiana' == player_one.first_name    assert 'Jones' == player_one.last_name    assert [] == player_one.guardiansdef test_add_guardian(player_one, guardians):    player_one.add_guardian(guardians[0])    assert [guardians[0]] == player_one.guardiansdef test_add_guardians(player_one, guardians):    player_one.add_guardian(guardians[0])    player_one.add_guardians((guardians[1], guardians[2]))    assert list(guardians) == player_one.guardiansdef test_primary_guardian(player_one, guardians):    player_one.add_guardian(guardians[0])    player_one.add_guardians((guardians[1], guardians[2]))    assert guardians[0] == player_one.primary_guardiandef test_no_primary_guardian(player_one):    with pytest.raises(IndexError) as exc:        player_one.primary_guardian    assert 'list index out of range' == str(exc.value)
```

Our tests are now easier to reason about.

Sharing Fixtures with `conftest.py`
===================================

Next we give `test_guardian.py` the same treatment:

``` {.prism-code .language-python .content style="color: rgb(156, 220, 254); background-color: rgb(30, 30, 30); font-size: large;"}
from typing import Tupleimport pytestfrom laxleague.guardian import Guardian@pytest.fixturedef guardians() -> Tuple[Guardian, ...]:    g1 = Guardian('Mary', 'Jones')    g2 = Guardian('Joanie', 'Johnson')    g3 = Guardian('Jerry', 'Johnson')    return g1, g2, g3def test_construction(guardians):    assert 'Mary' == guardians[0].first_name    assert 'Jones' == guardians[0].last_name
```

Hmm, something looks wrong. We said fixtures helped *avoid* repetition,
but this `guardians` fixture is the same as the one in `test_player.py`.
That's repetition. Is there a way to move fixtures out of tests, then
share them between tests?

Yes, in fact, multiple ways. The simplest is with `pytest`'s
`conftest.py` file. You put this in a test directory (or parent
directory, or grandparent etc.) and any fixtures defined there will be
available as an argument to a test.

Here's our `tests/conftest.py` file with the fixtures we just added in
`test_player.py`:

``` {.prism-code .language-python .content style="color: rgb(156, 220, 254); background-color: rgb(30, 30, 30); font-size: large;"}
from typing import Tupleimport pytestfrom laxleague.guardian import Guardianfrom laxleague.player import Player@pytest.fixturedef player_one() -> Player:    return Player('Tatiana', 'Jones')@pytest.fixturedef guardians() -> Tuple[Guardian, ...]:    g1 = Guardian('Mary', 'Jones')    g2 = Guardian('Joanie', 'Johnson')    g3 = Guardian('Jerry', 'Johnson')    return g1, g2, g3
```

Now our `test_guardian.py` is short and focused:

``` {.prism-code .language-python .content style="color: rgb(156, 220, 254); background-color: rgb(30, 30, 30); font-size: large;"}
def test_construction(guardians):    assert 'Mary' == guardians[0].first_name    assert 'Jones' == guardians[0].last_name
```

Same for `test_player.py`:

``` {.prism-code .language-python .content style="color: rgb(156, 220, 254); background-color: rgb(30, 30, 30); font-size: large;"}
import pytestdef test_construction(player_one):    assert 'Tatiana' == player_one.first_name    assert 'Jones' == player_one.last_name    assert [] == player_one.guardiansdef test_add_guardian(player_one, guardians):    player_one.add_guardian(guardians[0])    assert [guardians[0]] == player_one.guardiansdef test_add_guardians(player_one, guardians):    player_one.add_guardian(guardians[0])    player_one.add_guardians((guardians[1], guardians[2]))    assert list(guardians) == player_one.guardiansdef test_primary_guardian(player_one, guardians):    player_one.add_guardian(guardians[0])    player_one.add_guardians((guardians[1], guardians[2]))    assert guardians[0] == player_one.primary_guardiandef test_no_primary_guardian(player_one):    with pytest.raises(IndexError) as exc:        player_one.primary_guardian    assert 'list index out of range' == str(exc.value)
```

Life With Fixtures
==================

PyCharm has a number of useful features that make working with fixtures
a breeze. We saw autocomplete. This is even more important with all the
places that pytest can look for fixtures.

Navigation is a big win, for the same reason. `Cmd-Click` (macOS) on a
fixture name and PyCharm jumps to the fixture definition. Same applies
for hover which reveals type information.

[![Hover For Type
Information](./images/hover.png "Hover For Type Information")](./images/hover.png)

`F1` on the fixture shows an inline popup with more information about
the fixture. Finally, you can `Refactor | Rename` to change the
fixture's name and usages.

[![Refactor
Rename](./images/refactor_rename.png "Refactor Rename")](./images/refactor_rename.png)

This is all driven by PyCharm's type inferencing, which means we can
autocomplete and give warnings in the test body, based on the structure
of the fixture. In practice, this is a key part of "fail faster",
meaning, find a problem before running (or even writing) a test.
