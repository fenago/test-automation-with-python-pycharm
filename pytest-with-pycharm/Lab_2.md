----------------------------

Make a PyCharm project and virtual environment with dependencies, then
configure PyCharm to use pytest.



Python has projects and PyCharm does as well. In this tutorial step,
let's make both, with a virtual environment, and set the project up to
use `pytest`.

New Project
===========

We'll let the IDE guide us through the process. First, we use
`File -> New Project` to make a new project, in a directory:

[![New Project
Dialog](./images/new_project_dialog.png "New Project Dialog")](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/guide/static/d5291b3cf29b3e18e8b030e4f287eb12/612f7/new_project_dialog.png)

Make sure `Project Interpreter` is setup to configure a new virtual
environment. Expand the triangle if needed to set this up.

After clicking `Create`, tell PyCharm to open the project in a new
window.

Python Project
==============

[Python
packaging](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
is, alas, a thorny topic, and we're going to make you do it for this
tutorial.

Why?

Most Python packages put their tests *outside* of their source
directories, to avoid accidentally shipping the tests (among other
reasons.) The tests thus need to import the package that you code is in,
and that means a Python package. Fortunately this is [all explained
quite
well](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html#tests-outside-application-code)
in the `pytest` docs.

We first need a `setup.py` file at the top of our new project. Add the
following:

``` {.prism-code .language-python .content style="color: rgb(156, 220, 254); background-color: rgb(30, 30, 30); font-size: large;"}
from setuptools import find_packages, setupsetup(    name='laxleague',    extras_require=dict(tests=['pytest']),    packages=find_packages(where="src"),    package_dir={"": "src"},)
```

Our source will now go in a `src/laxleague` directory so make sure to
create it.

Why the use of `src`? It's a [general consensus best
practice](https://hynek.me/articles/testing-packaging/) that avoids
nasty surprises if you share your code or use it elsewhere. Our
`setup.py` has the `packages` and `packages_dir` keys added in support
of putting our code under `src`.

Now go to PyCharm's Terminal tool and type in the following:

``` {.prism-code .language-shell .content style="color:#9CDCFE;background-color:#1E1E1E;font-size:large"}
$ pip install -e .[tests]
```

This has two effects:

-   It makes this project an "editable install" by creating a directory
    named `src/laxleague.egg-info`

-   `pytest` is installed into the project's virtual environment

Apologies for this `setup.py` hocus-pocus. Python has a sordid history
on this, though it is getting better.

Give Me Some Source
===================

But we don't have any source code yet. Let's put a file at
`src/laxleague/player.py` containing an empty `Player` class:

``` {.prism-code .language-python .content style="color: rgb(156, 220, 254); background-color: rgb(30, 30, 30); font-size: large;"}
class Player:    pass
```

Configure Testing
=================

One last step...we need to tell PyCharm to use `pytest` for its built-in
Python testing support. This happens automatically when we first open an
existing project with `pytest` in the virtual environment. We added
`pytest` after making the environment, so we need to configure it
ourselves.

Go to `Settings -> Tools -> Python Integrated Tools` and change
`Default test runner:` to `pytest`:

[![Python Integrated
Tools](./images/python_integrated_tools.png "Python Integrated Tools")](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/guide/static/c8d60acd684e9f21738d574f61b0e2d8/91f10/python_integrated_tools.png)

Mine is set automatically because I set `pytest` as my [default test
runner for all
projects](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configure-project-settings.html#new-default-settings)
using
`File | New Projects Settings | Settings/Preferences for New Projects`:

Finally, make a top-level directory called `tests`. This mimics the
[pytest good
practices](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configure-project-settings.html#new-default-settings).

When done, your directory structure should look like this:
